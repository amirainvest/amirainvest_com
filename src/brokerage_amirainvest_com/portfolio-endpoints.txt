Question:
--------
Do we want to change the total return, beta and sharpe ratio values based on the timeframe shown in the graph?
And if we do.. do we want those calc's to happen on the frontend or backend? My inclination is backend and when you
click to change the timeframe on the chart, it updates those values.
--------
Answer: This would depend on how we want to deliver the historical data -- do we want to just deliver all time series data at once?
Or, do we want to use a request model with start/end times and query data that way?


# DJ Question: Do we want to use IEX to reconcile the pricing for the ticker here? Or, in the mean-time default to Plaid's
    security pricing. -- switch it out if we start having issues, leave for now
